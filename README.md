## Challenges and Learnings
- I had a great journey learning about Bootstrap and how to effectively use its components and grid system.
- I learned how to make a website fully responsive across different devices, which was a rewarding experience.
- One of the challenges I faced was matching the exact mockup with the design while using Bootstrap. Designing with precision to replicate the mockup was a bit difficult, but it helped me gain a deeper understanding of both Bootstrap and custom CSS.
- Optimizing images for responsiveness and maintaining their quality across screen sizes was another challenge, but it was a great learning experience.
